title: The UI starts to take shape

Mapping the data that we receive from the user is a major challenge with regard to the application that we have started to build. As a UI/UX person, a good experience is what makes it easy and intuitive for the user to use the particular application without a lengthy user manual or loads of text information about rules and regulations being dumped on the screen.

The UI for a map based application is quite a challenge to create because its not something that we can recreate but something that has to be used as a service that'd provided, be it from Google Maps or from Open Street Maps. After lots of debating about if we should go for Open Street Maps with Leaflet and MapBox or with Google Maps, we've decided to go for a combination of the technologies and some caching procedures so that either of the services don't lock us out.

At the moment, this is how the UI development looks like in the first round of user interface development.

There's still a lot of work to be done, either using a dynamic radius slider or a polygon filling procedure so that the data could be loaded onto the map. More challenging is to display the different types of problems. The design document has started to take shape and would be applied in the main development of the web user experience and design. At the same time, mobile application design and touch experiences would be rolled out sometime this month.

There's a long way to go, but well its off a good start.
