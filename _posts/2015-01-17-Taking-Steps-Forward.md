The holidays were a great time for brainstorming and working on the project. It's been a great ride through the project. Looks like there's going to be a part of the technology services sponsor for the project pretty soon and that's a great move ahead for the team and their enthusiasm.

The GEAR Systems project has started to get noticed in and around college with a few contributors willingly coming forward to help in creating this and making it happen. I think thats one of the major advantages of keeping this project open source, `Local Thinking, Global Impact`.

The team has had its few hits with one of its best design members `Rahul Yadav` who suddenly had to leave because of the sickness of a family member. We are with you Rahul !!

On the good side of things, the team has successfully received the support of two contributors `Sreerag Sreenath` who is working on the legal side (`CLAs`) and temporarily helping us out with the design work that was needed. Another contributor `Sunanda Dadi` has successfully helped in creation of the survey that would play a crucial role in the decisions that are being made from the development side, so that the product that the people want can be up and running in as little time as possible.

After a few long disucssions (Maybe these were debates) with Sunanda, Rajat and Rahul Jain, the surveys took shape and have started to move around on social media with a mixed feedback that is being received about its length. At the moment it takes on an average of 5 minutes to fill in the complete survey to help us out. Though the number of people who have filled the survey haven't skyrocketed, its a good start. Planning to get the inputs from the different age groups is being a challenge. We are thinking of newer ways to resolve this and make the survey reach out to more people.

The survey has had improvements based on the feedback of the initial responders and the number of responses recorded is slowly increasing. We expect around 500+ responses, wouldn't be so bad afterall.

Thanks to the contributors who have made this happen in the moments we needed the most. Looking forward to getting more contributors.
