The holidays have begun for us here at National Institute of Technology, Warangal and it feels a little hard to watch everyone pack their bags to leave home for the next nine to ten days that're yet to come, but at the same time, the sense of responsibility kicks in, to build the solution in these 9 days which could potentially impact thousands of people positively with a global impact. Looks like these vacations are going to be a game changer for the EPICS GEAR Systems project.

With half the phase one application work already done, i.e. getting the main base code of the server up and running, its time to collaborate and make peace with a few services and make them behave accordingly. The UI/UX team has a great role here in giving people what they really need in the way they need it. Simplicity and ease of usage is the main concern. The rest of the team is underway into making the surveys so that we can look into two different perspectives, the Social perspective of things and the technical perspective of things where we analyze the different behaviours and attitude of the people by voluntarily requesting a survey about their view of the government and the infrastructure, their problems faced and the way people can make a big difference.

Just as every project in its phases faces problems we also faced problems, though in our effort to get things done before _deadlines_ that were assigned, some of these items are related on the performance and completion of a set of tasks from the other team members or the 3rd party which would be helping us. _Getting to reach out to the local municipalities has become tough and it looks like we'd have to reprioritize the tasks in the team and get the few srevices up and running. Renting out the servers and the services required is still pending but that should hopefully be cleared soon with the help of `Dr.L.Anjaneyulu` who is our teams faculty in charge.

There were a few unexpected problems that we've faced in the process we were planning out. It was time to prepare the fish bone analysis for the problem that we've faced and analyse the reasons which could be pulling my team down.

I think a few of these problems can be solved with some support and cooperation, though it might take a little time it'll give rise to working things out faster. Since the problems have been identified i'll be working on ways to try getting a few of these problems sorted out so that the team can run back in its initial vigour.
