It was time to get online and put whatever we had built so far to the public, this is the time when a name on the web is an important deal. Today a major part of the blocker that we had, started to change, GEAR now officially has a gearsystems.org domain as its public face.

Its a small step forward towards the complete process that we aim for. Today was a pretty good day for the team when it comes to what has happened, Its time to now reconfigure the DNS settings to get the applications and the blogs running under the particular CNAMEs and A records. GitHub's been doing a really great job in keeping and hosting our Ruby Jekyll pages for running this blog. So thanks a lot for that Github.

[Kranthi](http://kranthi.gearsystems.org) is configuring the domain settings of all the blogs but it looks like the CNAMEs are temporarily misbehaving, maybe its too tired too. Been a pretty long day and almost 2AM, looks like its time to sleep for the day, hopefully all the issues will be fixed up by tomorrow.
