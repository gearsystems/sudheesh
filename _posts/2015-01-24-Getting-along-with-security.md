[GEAR](http://www.gearsystems.org/) is an ambitious project fueled with the desire to change the way complaints are taken, viewed and treated in the country. To pull off something of this scale it requires a lot of support that needs to be given.

Going open source has proved its importance, the community we build and the contributors who are willing to work along to make the change.

Though a lot of effort is put in by the team members, there's a point of time when even the smallest of the support given to us makes the product happen. We hereby thank our sponsors [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) and [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com) for providing the organization and the GEAR project with an SSL certificate for security and a fully paid Django development IDE for free.

Keeping the data secure and people safe is a major task that is up ahead and this support would be going a long way and paving the future to an open and a transparent complaint and its tracking system in India.
