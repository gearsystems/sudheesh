[GEAR](http://gearsystems.github.io), the very thought of it indicates motion for creating something amazing, the churning of a few of them combined resulting into endless different possibilites through their teamwork. Well ... We are the same. GEAR Stands for <em>Government Enhanced Administrative Resource </em>, an effort that is being made to make complaint systems easier.

As a team leader, Its a great responsibility to keep the team motivated and driving forward. Today, the assignment of tasks was done to all the members of the team and their work clearly delegated over cups of coffee. The design wireframes and the backend modelling started off sometime in the evening and was debated until late at night. The documentation of these design wireframes and the support will be documented sometime later before the 8th January 2015. Phew, Thats quite a deadline. Looks like [Rajat Ujawane](http://gearsystems.github.io/rajat),[Kranthi Kiran Guduru](http://gearsystems.github.io/kranthi) and [Me](http://gearsystems.github.io/sudheesh) would be pulling off an all nighter tomorrow too, best part ... We enjoy it !

[Arjun Bhargava](http://gearsystems.github.io/arjun) and [Rahul Jain](http://gearsystems.github.io/rahuljain) managed to put up the blogs of all the team members up and running and a new innovative way of visualization of the contributors to the project.

Well, We are not always the serious kind, Projects also mean fun and [Rahul Yadav](http://gearsystems.github.io/rahulyadav) made that part happen by clicking photographs and capturing the first few moments before this project took off in full swing.

There's a lot to look forward to and lots of challenges that are being encountered, administrative ones, technical ones and personal ones. Today was a fun day and at the end of it, the whole team had the feeling of accomplishment, finishing off tasks quickly and before time. I am proud of my team and their dedication for change. The journey begins.
