[Hackathons](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/hackathon/6) are always an amazing time for us at GEAR Systems, all our members love to experience the feeling of building something productive and useful at the end of 24 hours. This time for a change, instead of participating in the hackathon, we've decided to mentor the hackathon by giving them two problem statements instead. One problem statement includes building an AI based conversational twitter bot with [loklak](http://loklak.org) the distributed tweet search and harvest server that I've been working on as a part of Google Summer of Code 2015.

Many teams have applied to resolve these problem statements and it was a tough decision to short list a few teams to work on these AI bots. It was great to see loklak being used productively to build an AI system which can wait for a user to send a tweet to it, then reply back with the required information, this conversation continues back and forth and then registers the complaint into the database.

The loklak's scraping technology to learn about tweets anonymously by long polling them as well as the integration of the bot with the Twitter API made it possible for this to be achieved in such a short time. Thanks to the team of `Makala Aneesh`, `Vivek Unnikrishnan`, `Rohit Tanwar`, `Rishabh Karajagi` and `Sreerag Sreenath` to work on this problem statement and turn this into a great success.
