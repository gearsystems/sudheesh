While functionality is one of the most important factor that is needed for the web application, A good user experience and ease of usage is also one of the major tasks for us while building this software solution.

Many hours of effort has been put up to visualize the data that humans understand with the underlying power running in the code that makes this happen. A nice animation and good graphics is always better than dumping an excel sheet or a table filled with information to the users.

There are different kinds of users who would be using this software, therefore it becomes important to make it easy to use that every single person intuitively knows what to do and what to press. This analysis of design complexity, user behaviour has finally resulted in building and revamping the entire new User Experience. The work now looks as below.

There's still a lot of work pending before this product could be launched out to the public but with all the plans successfully falling into place, hopefully that should happen soon. Wish you all a very happy republic day. #26thJanuary2015
