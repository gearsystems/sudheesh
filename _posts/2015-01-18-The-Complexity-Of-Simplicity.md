	Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple. That is why its so complicated.

The [survey](http://goo.gl/forms/kDQ4nddefH) responses are slowly rolling in and the team has been back up working on building this dream solution and making it a reality.

Strict deadlines put pressure but nevertheless release the best in the productivity and makes sure that the work is done in the fastest way possible. This added with a peer reviewed technique makes sure that one thinks of the most optimal way to program the solution instead of just building a `Hack` around the problem. 

This pressure is playing well and things have progressed since the last time. It took some time to get the google maps to behave the way it was supposed to for us, this involved quite a little bit of tweaking and not to forget, lots of googling around. The UI/UX now supports markers along with a draggable area where the contents could be loaded. Looks like there's some heavy mathematics involved in the upcoming few days of development.

Users are an integral part, the web application now supports an awesome authentication procedure where the users could register and see the different problems which are marked. Very soon new features would be rolled out, but this is good work for a week.

Ease of usage has been one of the most debated factors in all the team meetings, this has resulted in long debates and discussions over coffee, wireframing, scrapping it and rewireframing the design before jumping over to the code.

There's a lot more technology changes that would be rolling out soon, it's been a great learning experience to work with production level engines and technologies. Looks like the plan is working out well.
