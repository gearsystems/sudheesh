It was a moment of delight when a letter informing the invite to speak about this project as GEAR and a part of it dealing with data visualizations to make faster and better government decisions had been selected to FOSSASIA'15 at NUS@Blk71 Singapore.

It was a great opportunity for a new open source organization like ours to be selected for Asia's largest open source conference. There were 128 speakers including me `(Yay)` from 27 countries and 900+ attendees to the event to listen to us. Obviously for an event this large, It was the best chance for us to meet new like minded people and learn more about them, their work while at the same time making friends with them. Things turned out really well for those 3 days I stayed in Singapore attending the talks before and after my talk, and interacting with the other awesome speakers.

The first day started with Justin helping the other speakers who were early in Singapore checkout the place, visit the National Design Centre, the fablabs and followed by dinner. The second day started off with amazing talks from some of the finest developers in open source organizations and captivated the whole audience. At the event I also managed to meet up with my other friends from Mozilla, an organization to contribute to and ended up having a great time shopping and exploring the city until 3AM in the morning after the talks on the second day were over.

I had met some of the best and smartest people here at this conference, had detailed talks with them off conference hours and made some good friends. Michael Peter (@0rbit3r) presented his talk on this amazing new thing called Loklak which was a distributed tweet search server. Immediately I knew that I had to contribute to this organization because of its immense value to our project GEAR. We caught up a few hours later and spoke about the possibilities that Loklak could give for us at GEAR to build amazing systems.

I was quite impressed with Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan's talk on transparency and importance. FOSSASIA'15 provided me a great chance to talk to Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, the Singapore minister in charge of the smart nation initiative and explain what we were doing with GEAR and the work so far, the plans etc.., what more, it resulted in a selfie !! `(Yay !!)`

I also met amazing people from the LibreOffice organization, MySQL, MariaDB, Privly and so many more. It was a great time and I never realized that the conference was over. Looking forward to attend FOSSASIA again next year. Great effort put in by the organizers Hong, Mario, Justin and all the volunteers. Great job !!
